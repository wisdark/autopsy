.kdb files can be placed in this directory and they will be treated as Official Hash Sets within autopsy.  Official Hash Sets will be readonly within the application.  Official Hash Sets should have the following naming convention: '<dbName>.<knownStatus>.kdb' where '<dbName>' is the name of the Official Hash Set and '<knownStatus>' is the known status of the hash set.  The known status is the identifier for one of the variable names represented in the enum: HashDbManager.HashDb.KnownFilesType.  As an example, a possible value could be: 'Foo.Notable.kdb' where the name of the Official Hash Set is 'Foo' and the known status is 'Notable' which is the identifier for KnownFilesType.KNOWN_BAD.
