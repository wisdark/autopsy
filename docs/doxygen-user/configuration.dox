[TOC]

\section config_overview Overview

You can configure Autopsy through the main options panel. This is accessed by going to Tools->Options. Here you can change how cases are displayed, configure how Autopsy runs, and create hash sets, keyword lists, etc. 

The options panel has different tabs for each feature. These options are documented on the main pages for each feature. For example, the \ref keyword_search_configuration_dialog "keyword search options panel" is described on the main \ref keyword_search_page page. The tabs that do not go with a feature documented elsewhere will be described here.

\section config_app Application Options

The first tab on the options panel is for general application settings.

The top section lets you adjust how much memory is used by Autopsy and how many log files to keep. Generally each Autopsy session generates one log file, though it can generate more if the log file becomes too large. 

The next section lets you specify where Autopsy should store temporary files. These files will be deleted when a case is closed. 

The final section lets you set a custom logo.

This logo will be displayed in any generated \ref report_html "HTML reports".

\section config_view View Options

See the \ref view_options_page page for a description of how you can customize what data is displayed in Autopsy.

\section config_ext_viewer External Viewers

The External Viewers tab allows you to add file associations and select a hex editor.

The top section allows you to enter custom file associations by either extension or MIME type. In the image above we've associated .xml files with the Notepad application. Now it is possible to right click on a .xml file in the results viewer and choose "Open in external viewer" to open that .xml file in Notepad.

The bottom section allows you to specify a hex editor. HxD has been tested and is the default, but other hex editors will work as well. The selected hex editor will be launched when clicking the "Launch in HxD" button in the "Hex" tab of the \ref content_viewer_page.

\section config_general General Options

The general options tab allows you to configure proxy settings.
